# Simplified Instruction Set Processor

This project is a C-based software simulation of a **simplified instruction set processor**.  
It aims to deepen understanding of processor architecture through hands-on implementation.

## Overview
The project focuses on the fundamentals of **instruction decoding**, **execution**, **memory management**, and **register manipulation**.  
By simulating a basic CPU, this project lays the groundwork for exploring more advanced topics in computer architecture and systems design.

## Project Description
The simulated processor:
- Reads instructions and data from an input text file  
- Decodes and executes each instruction sequentially  
- Manages a simple memory model and register set  
- Outputs the results of execution to the console or a file  

The processor operates on **32-bit unsigned integers** only, ensuring predictable behavior and simplifying arithmetic operations.

## Objectives
- Reinforce knowledge of CPU architecture and data flow  
- Practice low-level systems programming in C  
- Gain familiarity with the structure and function of machine instructions  
- Simulate the execution pipeline from fetch to write-back
