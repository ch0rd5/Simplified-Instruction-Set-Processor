# Simplified-Instruction-Set-Processor
This project is to design and implement a simplified instruction set processor using C.

I will deepen my uderstanding of processor architecture by developing a software simulation of a CPU.

This project focuses on applying knowledge of instruction decoding, execution, memory management, and register manipulation, laying the groundwork for more advaced topics in computer architecture.

# Project Description:
In this project, a simplified processor will be simulated and execute a set of predefined instructions. The processor will read instructions and data from a input text file, decode the instructinos, execute them, and output the results. This project is designed to work with 32-bit unsigned integers only.
