# Simplified Instruction Set Processor

This project is a **C++ simulation of a simplified CPU**, designed to demonstrate how processors decode and execute instructions.  
It provides hands-on experience with core computer architecture concepts like instruction execution, register operations, and memory manipulation.

---

##  Overview

The program reads a list of assembly-like instructions from an input text file (`pp2_input.txt`), executes them one by one, and displays the resulting state of registers and memory after each instruction.

This simulation focuses on understanding:
- Instruction decoding and control flow
- Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) operations
- Memory addressing and data transfer
- Comparison and branching logic
